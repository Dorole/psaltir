My first Flutter app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and Dart.

📲 The aim is to have a minimalist, user-friendly reading app that will let the user choose the reading mode, store their favorite psalms and read them on the go. The content will be available in Croatian.

📲 My plan is to try and get it on Play Store and App Store.

📝 See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed history of changes.
