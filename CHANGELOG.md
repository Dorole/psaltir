# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### 2025-10-28

- NavBar holds basic logic and leads to separate pages.
- Functioning radio buttons for psalm category and psalm number.
- A functioning button that will trigger reading. Currently only performs necessary checks and prints the action it will perform.
- Added tooltips to ‚ÑπÔ∏è icons.

üìã TO DO:

- Refactor HomePage - separate widgets
- Keep HomePage state when navigating to another page then back
- Implement an initial Theme - customize later
- Refactor to use Provider

üì∑ See [SCREENSHOTS](screenshots/2025-10-28/). 
Note that the current design is only there so I have something to work with, it's not final.

### 2025-10-24

- Basic structure and ROUGH design.
- Most widgets only visual, no logic.
