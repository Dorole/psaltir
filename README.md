My first Flutter app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and Dart.

The aim is to have a minimalist, user-friendly reading app that will let the user choose the reading mode, store their favorite psalms and read them on the go. The content will be available in Croatian.

My plan is to try and put it on Play Store and App Store.

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed history of changes.

To run this project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dorole/psaltir.git
cd psaltir
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
